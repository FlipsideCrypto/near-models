# Workflow Failure Investigation Process

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic process for investigating workflow failures in GitHub Actions and resolving data issues. This workflow should be followed when a job fails to ensure thorough root cause analysis and proper resolution.

## Prerequisites
- Access to GitHub Actions logs
- Snow CLI configured for Snowflake access
- Access to the dbt project repository
- Understanding of dbt model naming conventions

## Available Tools

### Primary CLI Tools
- **`gh`**: GitHub CLI for accessing GitHub Actions and repository data
  - List workflow runs: `gh run list`
  - View failed runs: `gh run list --status failure`
  - Get run details: `gh run view <run-id>`
  - Download logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log`
  - List runs for specific workflow: `gh run list --workflow="<workflow-name>"`

- **`snow`**: Snowflake CLI for direct database operations
  - Execute SQL queries: `snow sql -q "SELECT ..."`
  - Interactive SQL shell: `snow sql`
  - View connection info: `snow connection list`

### Additional Resources
- **Web Search**: Use Claude Code's web search feature to access current documentation
  - Snowflake documentation for error codes and SQL syntax
  - dbt documentation for configuration options and best practices
  - GitHub repository documentation for project-specific guidelines
  - Stack Overflow and community resources for complex issues

### File System Tools
- **Read/Edit capabilities**: Direct access to dbt model files, configuration files, and documentation
- **Glob/Grep tools**: Search for patterns across files and directories
- **Directory navigation**: Explore project structure and locate relevant files

## Step 1: Identify the Failure

### 1.1 Locate the Failed Job Run
Use the GitHub CLI to find the target failed job. **Required**: Repository name (e.g., `FlipsideCrypto/near-models`). **Optional**: Specific workflow name (e.g., `dbt_run_scheduled_non_core`).

```bash
# List recent failed runs for the repository
gh run list --status failure --limit 10

# If you know the specific workflow name, filter by it
gh run list --status failure --workflow="<workflow-name>" --limit 10

# Example for near-models scheduled job
gh run list --status failure --workflow="dbt_run_scheduled_non_core" --limit 5
```

### 1.2 Extract Job Details
From the failed runs list, identify the target failure and extract key details:

```bash
# Get detailed logs from the specific failed run
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Search for specific error patterns in the logs
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -A 10 -B 5 "ERROR\|FAIL\|Database Error"
```

### 1.3 Document Initial Findings
From the GitHub Actions output, record:
- **Run ID**: For reference and log access
- **Workflow Name**: The specific job that failed  
- **Timestamp**: When the failure occurred
- **Failed Model(s)**: Specific dbt model(s) that caused the failure
- **Error Type**: Initial categorization (Database Error, Compilation Error, etc.)
- **Error Message**: Exact error text from the logs
- **Snowflake User**: Extract the user context (typically `DBT_CLOUD_<PROJECT>`)

### 1.4 Categorize Error Types
Common dbt error patterns to look for in the logs:
- **Compilation Errors**: SQL syntax, missing references, schema issues
- **Runtime Errors**: Data type mismatches, constraint violations, timeouts
- **Database Errors**: Permission issues, connection problems
- **Constraint Violations**: Unique key violations, not-null violations
- **Resource Issues**: Memory limits, query timeouts

### 1.5 Prepare for Snowflake Investigation
With the GitHub Actions information gathered, prepare for the next phase:
- Failed model name (e.g., `silver__burrow_repays`)
- Database schema (e.g., `NEAR.silver`)
- Snowflake user (format: `DBT_CLOUD_<PROJECT>`)
- Specific error code and message
- Affected table/view names
- Timeframe for Snowflake query search

## Step 2: Query Snowflake for Failed Operations

### 2.1 Find Recent Failed Queries
Use the Snow CLI to search for failed queries related to the job:

```shell
snow sql -q "
-- Search for failed queries by user and time
SELECT 
    query_id,
    query_text,
    execution_status,
    start_time,
    end_time,
    user_name,
    error_message
FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
WHERE user_name = 'DBT_CLOUD_<PROJECT>'
    AND execution_status = 'FAILED'
    AND start_time >= DATEADD(hour, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### 2.2 Search by Error Pattern
If searching by user doesn't yield results, search by error pattern:

```shell
snow sql -q "
-- Search for specific error types
SELECT 
    query_id,
    query_text,
    execution_status,
    start_time,
    user_name,
    error_message
FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
WHERE error_message ILIKE '%<ERROR_PATTERN>%'
    AND start_time >= DATEADD(day, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### 2.3 Extract Failed SQL
- Copy the complete failed SQL query
- Identify the operation type (INSERT, MERGE, CREATE, etc.)
- Note any specific conditions or filters that might be relevant

## Step 3: Analyze the dbt Model

### 3.1 Locate the Model File
dbt models follow the naming convention: `<schema>__<table_name>.sql`
- Example: `NEAR.SILVER.TABLE_ABC` â†’ `models/silver/../silver__table_abc.sql`

### 3.2 Review Model Configuration
Examine the model's dbt configuration:
- Materialization strategy (`incremental`, `table`, `view`)
- Unique key definition
- Incremental strategy and predicates
- Any custom configurations

### 3.3 Understand the Logic
- Read through the SQL logic
- Identify CTEs and their purposes
- Understand data transformations
- Note any complex joins or aggregations

### 3.4 Identify Dependencies
- Check `ref()` calls for upstream dependencies
- Verify `source()` references
- Map the data lineage

## Step 4: Reproduce and Diagnose the Issue

### 4.1 Reconstruct the Failed Query
Based on the dbt model logic, recreate the SQL that would generate the temporary table or final result:

```shell
snow sql -q "
-- Example: Recreate the logic that caused the failure
WITH [CTEs from the model]
SELECT 
    [fields from the model],
    [unique_key_logic] AS surrogate_key,
    COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM [final CTE]
GROUP BY [all fields except count]
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
"
```

### 4.2 Identify Root Cause
Common issues to investigate:
- **Duplicate Key Violations**: Multiple rows generating the same unique key
- **Data Type Issues**: Incompatible data types in joins or operations
- **Null Value Problems**: Unexpected nulls in required fields
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect business logic producing invalid results
- **Upstream Data Issues**: Problems in source data or dependencies

### 4.3 Analyze Upstream Dependencies
If the issue appears to be data-related:
- Check upstream models for recent changes
- Verify source data quality
- Look for schema changes in dependencies

## Step 5: Develop Proposed Solution

### 5.1 Design a Proposed Fix
Based on the root cause analysis:
- **For Unique Key Issues**: Enhance the surrogate key with additional fields
- **For Data Quality Issues**: Add validation or filtering logic
- **For Logic Errors**: Correct the business logic
- **For Schema Issues**: Update model to handle schema changes

### 5.2 Investigation Log
Document the investigation process including:

**Error Summary:**
- Model: `<model_name>`
- Error Type: `<error_category>`
- Timestamp: `<when_occurred>`

**Root Cause:**
- Brief description of what caused the failure
- Specific technical details (e.g., "Multiple log entries from single action generating duplicate surrogate keys")

**Key Queries Used:**
```sql
-- Only include queries that revealed important information
-- Query 1: Found the failed merge operation
SELECT query_id, error_message FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history WHERE...

-- Query 2: Identified duplicate records
SELECT receipt_id, action_index, COUNT(*) FROM... GROUP BY... HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Description of the fix applied
- Files modified
- Rationale for the approach chosen

## Best Practices

### Investigation Approach
1. **Be Systematic**: Follow the steps in order to avoid missing important information
2. **Be Verbose**: Document your thought process and reasoning during investigation
3. **Focus on Root Cause**: Don't just fix symptoms; understand why the issue occurred
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure the fix works and doesn't introduce new issues

### Query Guidelines
- Use time-based filters to narrow search scope
- Start with broad searches and narrow down
- Save successful queries for documentation
- Use appropriate LIMIT clauses to avoid overwhelming results

### Documentation Standards
- Only log queries that provided meaningful insights
- Include enough context for another analyst to understand and replicate
- Explain the reasoning behind the solution chosen
- Reference any external resources or documentation used

## Common Error Patterns and Solutions

### Duplicate Key Violations
- **Symptom**: "Duplicate row detected during DML action"
- **Investigation**: Find the duplicate surrogate key values and trace to source
- **Solution**: Enhance unique key with additional distinguishing fields

### Data Type Mismatches
- **Symptom**: "cannot be cast to..." errors
- **Investigation**: Check upstream schema changes or data evolution
- **Solution**: Add explicit casting or handle data type evolution

### Permission Errors
- **Symptom**: "not authorized" or permission denied
- **Investigation**: Check if tables/schemas exist and permissions are correct
- **Solution**: Coordinate with infrastructure team for access

### Incremental Logic Issues
- **Symptom**: Missing or duplicate data in incremental models
- **Investigation**: Check incremental predicates and merge logic
- **Solution**: Adjust incremental strategy or add proper filtering

This process ensures thorough investigation and proper resolution of dbt job failures while maintaining a clear audit trail for future reference.
