  name: tests__logs_gap
  description: |-
    This test checks for gaps in logs by checking against the initial receipts model and receipts_final.
    If there are gaps between receipts and receipts_final, that will likely lead to log gaps.
    The user must look at the data to determine where the gap may be.
