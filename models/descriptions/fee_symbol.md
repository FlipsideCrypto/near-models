{% docs fee_symbol %}

Token symbol for the fee token (e.g., 'NEAR', 'USDT', 'USDC'). This field provides the human-readable abbreviated identifier for the token in which the intent execution fee was paid. Fee tokens are commonly stablecoins or native protocol tokens, and this symbol enables easy identification for reporting, analytics, and user interfaces without needing to reference contract addresses.
