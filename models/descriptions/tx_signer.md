{% docs tx_signer %}

Account that originally signed the transaction, can be a relayer. This field identifies the account that cryptographically signed the transaction, authorizing it to be executed on the blockchain. In relay transactions, this may be a relayer account rather than the end user, while in direct transactions, it represents the actual user or contract initiating the transaction.
