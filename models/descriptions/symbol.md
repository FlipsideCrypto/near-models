{% docs symbol %}

Token symbol (e.g., 'wNEAR', 'SWEAT'). This field contains the abbreviated identifier for the token as commonly used in trading pairs, price feeds, and user interfaces. Token symbols are typically 2-6 characters long and provide a quick way to identify tokens without using their full contract addresses. Examples include 'NEAR' for the native token, 'wNEAR' for wrapped NEAR, and 'USDC' for USD Coin.
