{% docs fee_blockchain %}

Source blockchain for the fee token, derived from the token metadata. For tokens on NEAR, this value is "near". For cross-chain tokens bridged to NEAR, this indicates the origin blockchain (e.g., "ethereum", "bsc", "polygon"). This field enables cross-chain fee analysis and helps identify which blockchain ecosystems are being used to pay intent execution fees.
