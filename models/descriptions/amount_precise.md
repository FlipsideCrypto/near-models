{% docs amount_precise %}

Decimal adjusted amount of tokens (as text, for highest precision). This field provides the token amount after applying decimal precision adjustments, stored as a text string to maintain the highest possible precision without any floating-point rounding errors. This format is particularly useful for tokens with very high decimal precision or when exact precision is critical for financial calculations.
