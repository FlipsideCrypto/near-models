{% docs source_address %}

The originating address from which tokens are being sent, in a transfer or bridge transaction.  

This addressed is ascertained as best as possible, but may be null depending on the available information.  

Example 1 - tx CzPRdoiU74bo9yqqt9fCP5Xdab2mPVqxr9gU5xeaQA4a stores just "signer_public_key 0x0x1589â€¦f694" on chain.  

Example 2 - tx FA7tQeGQnhminbas28YgaizwmT4vnEUiCr3vdXmN3Xjn does not log any signing address at all.
