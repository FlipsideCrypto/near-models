{% docs decimals %}

Number of decimal places for the token. This field specifies the precision of the token, indicating how many decimal places should be used when converting from raw on-chain amounts to human-readable values. For example, NEAR has 24 decimals, so 1 NEAR = 1e24 raw units. Most ERC-20 tokens use 18 decimals, while some tokens may use different precision based on their design requirements.
