{% docs creator %}

The source or entity that created this label. This field indicates who or what system generated the address label. Almost always "flipside" for automatically generated labels, but can also be "user_submitted" for community-contributed labels. This helps track the provenance and reliability of the labeling information, distinguishing between automated system labels and manually curated community contributions.
