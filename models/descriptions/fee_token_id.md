{% docs fee_token_id %}

Full token identifier string for the fee token as it appears in the fees_collected object from the DIP4 log. This field contains the complete token reference including the token standard prefix and contract address (e.g., "nep141:wrap.near" or "nep245:usdt.tether-token.near"). This raw format preserves the exact on-chain representation and token standard information, which is essential for accurate token identification and cross-referencing with metadata.
