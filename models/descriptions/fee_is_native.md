{% docs fee_is_native %}

Boolean flag indicating whether the fee token is the native token of its blockchain. TRUE indicates the fee was paid in the blockchain's native token (e.g., NEAR, ETH, MATIC), while FALSE indicates a fungible token contract. This distinction is important for fee analysis as native tokens often have different pricing mechanics, liquidity characteristics, and user preferences compared to ERC-20 or NEP-141 tokens.
