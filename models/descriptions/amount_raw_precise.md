{% docs amount_raw_precise %}

Decimal adjusted amount of tokens (high precision float). This field provides the token amount after applying decimal precision adjustments, stored as a high-precision floating-point number. Unlike amount_adj which may have some rounding, this field maintains maximum precision for calculations requiring exact decimal representation of token amounts.
