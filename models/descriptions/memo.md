{% docs memo %}

Optional log message within the transaction (often null). This field contains additional information or context about the transfer, such as transaction notes, reference numbers, or descriptive text. Memos are commonly used in cross-chain bridges, exchange deposits, or other scenarios where additional context is needed to identify or process the transfer. The memo field is optional and frequently null for standard transfers.
