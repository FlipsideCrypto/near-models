{% docs amount_usd %}

USD value of the token transfer (null if hourly price not available). This field provides the dollar equivalent value of the token transfer by multiplying the decimal-adjusted token amount by the token's USD price at the time of the transfer. This field is null when price data is unavailable, which can occur for new tokens, tokens with low liquidity, or during periods when price feeds are unavailable.
