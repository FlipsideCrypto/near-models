{% docs action_index %}

Index of the action within the transaction. This field indicates the position of the action in the sequence of actions within the transaction. Actions are processed in order, and this index helps maintain the chronological sequence and relationship between multiple actions in a single transaction. The first action has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.
