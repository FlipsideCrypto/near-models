{% docs transfer_type %}

Nature of the transfer. This field categorizes the type of token transfer being performed. Common values include "native" for raw NEAR token transfers, "nep141" for fungible token transfers following the NEAR token standard, and other protocol-specific transfer types. This helps distinguish between different token standards and transfer mechanisms used on the NEAR blockchain.
