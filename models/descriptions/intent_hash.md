{% docs intent_hash %}

Unique hash identifier for the intent, extracted from the DIP4 event log. This hash uniquely identifies the specific intent execution and can be used to track and correlate all activities related to a particular intent across different tables and events. The intent hash is generated by the intent protocol and serves as the primary reference for linking intent-related data including fees, transfers, and execution details.
