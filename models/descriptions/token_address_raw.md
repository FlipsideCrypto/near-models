{% docs token_address_raw %}

The raw token identifier as it appears on-chain, including the full token ID with blockchain prefix and contract address. For NEAR tokens, this includes the full token ID format (e.g., 'nep141:token.near.omft.near'). This field preserves the original token representation before any parsing or standardization is applied.
