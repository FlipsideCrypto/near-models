    description: |-
      Comprehensive easy-access table containing all NEAR Protocol token price data with enhanced metadata and native token pricing for streamlined analytics. This model serves as the primary analytics-ready table for token price data in the gold layer, providing normalized access to hourly prices with token symbols, blockchain associations, and price quality indicators. The model transforms raw price data from silver__complete_token_prices and silver__complete_native_prices into structured columns for efficient querying and analysis. It includes critical price information such as hourly prices, token symbols, blockchain platforms, decimal precision, and price quality flags (imputed, deprecated, native). This table is essential for token price analytics, USD value calculations, market performance tracking, and economic activity monitoring. The data flows from multiple price providers with native and non-native token pricing unified to provide comprehensive price context. This table represents the most user-friendly view of token pricing on NEAR, enabling detailed analysis of price movements, market dynamics, and economic trends across all supported tokens.
