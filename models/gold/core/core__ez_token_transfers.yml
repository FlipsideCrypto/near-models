    description: |-
      This easy-access table contains all NEAR Protocol token transfers with price data and decimal-adjusted amounts for enhanced analytics. It serves as the primary analytics-ready table for token transfer data in the gold layer, providing normalized access to native NEAR transfers and NEP-141 fungible token transfers with USD valuations. The model transforms raw transfer data from core__fact_token_transfers into structured columns with price data and decimal adjustments for efficient querying and analysis. It includes critical transfer information such as sender/receiver addresses, token amounts, USD valuations, transfer types, and execution status. This table is essential for token flow analytics, DeFi protocol analysis, whale tracking, and economic activity monitoring. The data flows from core__fact_token_transfers with price data joined from price__ez_prices_hourly and metadata from silver__ft_contract_metadata, with decimal adjustments and USD calculations applied. This table represents the most complete view of NEAR ecosystem token movement, enabling detailed analysis of capital flows and economic activity patterns.
