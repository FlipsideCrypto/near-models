    description: >
      This model extracts data from core__ez_actions for NEAR Protocol lockup contract actions. 
      It captures lockup contract creation events and associated parameters like lockup duration, 
      vesting schedules, and release durations. The model processes actions with method names 
      'on_lockup_create', 'create', and 'new' from lockup.near contracts.
