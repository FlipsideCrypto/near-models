# Near Lake Silver Models

The models in this directory were used to ingest and process the blocks and shards from the Near Lake Indexer.  

They are being deprecated as of February 2025 in favor of Streamline 2.  

Todo - around 30-60 days after the migration, these models will be deleted and the associated tables likely dropped from Snowflake.
